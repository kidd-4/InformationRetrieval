I. Guiding Principles
¶




A. A Few Key Points
¶




Keep any API keys or other access credentials private and use only as permitted.


Respect our requirements on how to display and interact with users’ content.


If your application will need more than 1 million user tokens, you must 
contact us
 about your Twitter API access, as you may be subject to additional terms.
          


Twitter may monitor your use of the Twitter API to improve the Twitter Services, examine commercial use and ensure your compliance with this Policy.


Remember, Twitter may suspend or revoke access to the Twitter API if we believe you are in violation of this Policy. Do not apply for or register additional API tokens if Twitter has suspended your account. Instead, 
contact us
.
          








B. Maintain the Integrity of Twitter’s Products
¶




Follow the 
Display Requirements
, 
Twitter Rules
 and 
Periscope Community Guidelines
. If your Service facilitates or induces users to violate the 
Twitter Rules
 or 
Periscope Community Guidelines
, you must figure out how to prevent the abuse or Twitter may suspend or terminate your access to the Twitter API. We’ve provided guidance in our 
Abuse Prevention and Security help page
.
          


If your Service submits content to Twitter that includes a Twitter username, submit the correct Twitter username (“@username”).


Do not modify, translate or delete a portion of the Content.


Maintain the features and functionality of Content and Twitter API. Do not interfere with, intercept, disrupt, filter, or disable any features of Twitter or the Twitter API, including the Content of 
embedded Tweets
 and 
embedded timelines
.
          


Do not exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls, sharing, privacy settings, or use permitted in this Policy, or as otherwise set forth on the 
Developer Site
, or communicated to you by Twitter.
          


Do not remove or alter any proprietary notices or marks on Content or the Twitter API.


Do not (and do not allow others to) aggregate, cache, or store location data and other geographic information contained in the Content, except as part of a Tweet or Periscope Broadcast. Any use of location data or geographic information on a standalone basis is prohibited.








C. Respect Users’ Control and Privacy
¶




Get the user’s express consent before you do any of the following:
            


Take any actions on a user’s behalf, including posting Content, following/unfollowing other users, modifying profile information, starting a Periscope Broadcast or adding hashtags or other data to the user's Tweets. A user authenticating through your Service does not constitute user consent.


Republish Content accessed by means other than via the Twitter API or other Twitter tools.


Use a user’s Content to promote a commercial product or service, either on a commercial durable good or as part of an advertisement.


Store non-public Content such as Direct Messages or other private or confidential information.


Share or publish protected Content, private or confidential information.


Configure media to be sent in a Direct Message as "shared" (i.e. reusable across multiple Direct Messages). You must also provide the user with clear notice that "shared" media sent in a Direct Message will be viewable by anyone with the media's URL.






Do not (and do not permit others to) associate the Content with any person, household, device, browser, or other individual identifier, unless you or the entity on whose sole behalf you make such an association do so (a) with the express opt-in consent of the applicable individual; or (b) based solely on publicly available data and/or data provided directly by the applicable individual that the individual would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose.


If Content is deleted, gains 
protected status
, or is otherwise suspended, withheld, modified, or removed from the Twitter Service (including removal of location information), you will make all reasonable efforts to delete or modify such Content (as applicable) as soon as reasonably possible, and in any case within 24 hours after a request to do so by Twitter or by a Twitter user with regard to their Content, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law or regulation, and with the express written permission of Twitter.


If your Service will display Content to the public or to end users of your Service, and you do not use 
Twitter Kit
 or 
Twitter for Websites
 to do so, then you must use the Twitter API to retrieve the most current version of the Content for such display. If Content ceases to be available through the Twitter API, you may not display such Content and must remove it from non-display portions of your Service as soon as reasonably possible.
          


If your Service allows users to post Content to Twitter, then, before publishing, show the user exactly what will be published, including whether any geotags will be added to the Content. If you will send read receipt events for Direct Messages, you should inform users they will be sent as part of a conversation, such as by directly providing this notice to users in your application or by displaying read receipts from other participants in a conversation.


If your Service allows users to post Content to your Service and Twitter, then, before publishing to the Service:
            


Explain how you will use the Content;


Obtain proper permission to use the Content; and


Continue to use such Content in accordance with this Policy in connection with the Content.






Display your Service’s privacy policy to users before download, installation or sign up of your application. Your privacy policy must be consistent with all applicable laws, and be no less protective of end users than Twitter’s Privacy Policy located at 
https://twitter.com/privacy
 including any relevant incorporated policies such as the supplemental terms located at 
https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172501
. You must comply with your privacy policy, which must clearly disclose the information you collect from users, how you use and share that information (including with Twitter), and how users can contact you with inquiries and requests regarding their information. If for any reason you are unable to comply with your privacy policy or any privacy requirement of the Developer Agreement or Policy, you must promptly 
inform Twitter
 and take reasonable and appropriate steps to remedy any non-compliance, or cease your access to the Twitter API and use of all Twitter Content.
          


If your Service uses cookies, disclose in your privacy policy:
            


Whether third parties collect user information on your Service and across other websites or online services;


Information about user options for cookie management and whether you honor the 
Do Not Track
 setting in supporting web browsers.
              






If your Service adds location information to users’ Tweets or Periscope Broadcasts:
            


Disclose when you add location information, whether as a geotag or annotations data, and whether you add a place or specific coordinates.


Comply with 
Geo Developers Guidelines
 if your application allows users to Tweet with their location.
              






Do not store Twitter passwords.








D. Clearly Identify Your Service
¶




Make sure users understand your identity and the source and purpose of your Service. For example:
            


Don’t use a name or logo that falsely implies you or your company is related to another business or person.


Don’t use a shortened URL for your Service that attempts to mask the destination site.


Don’t use a URL for your Service that directs users to
                


a site that is unrelated to your Service


a site that encourages users to violate the 
Twitter Rules
 or 
the Periscope Community Guidelines.




a spam or malware site.










Do not replicate, frame, or mirror the Twitter website or its design.








E. Keep Twitter Spam Free
¶




Follow the Abuse and Spam rules 
here
.
          


Comply with the 
automation rules
 if your Service performs automatic actions.
          


Do not do any of the following:
            


Mass-register applications.


Create tokens/applications to sell names, prevent others from using names, or other commercial use.


Use third-party content feeds to update and maintain accounts under those third parties’ names.


Name squat by submitting multiple applications with the same function under different names.


Publish links to malicious content.


Publish pornographic or obscene images to user profile images and background images.












F. Be a Good Partner to Twitter
¶




Follow the 
guidelines
 for using Tweets in broadcast if you display Tweets offline and the 
guidelines
 for using Periscope Broadcasts in a broadcast if you display Periscope Broadcasts offline.
          


If you provide Content to third parties, including downloadable datasets of Content or an API that returns Content, you will only distribute or allow download of Tweet IDs, Direct Message IDs, and/or User IDs.
            


You may, however, provide export via non-automated means (e.g., download of spreadsheets or PDF files, or use of a “save as” button) of up to 50,000 public Tweet Objects and/or User Objects per user of your Service, per day.


Any Content provided to third parties remains subject to this Policy, and those third parties must agree to the Twitter 
Terms of Service
, 
Privacy Policy
, 
Developer Agreement
, and 
Developer Policy
 before receiving such downloads.
                


You may not distribute more than 1,500,000 Tweet IDs to any entity (inclusive of multiple individual users associated with a single entity) within any given 30 day period, unless you are doing so on behalf of an academic institution and for the sole purpose of non-commercial research or you have received the express written permission of Twitter.


You may not distribute Tweet IDs for the purposes of (a) enabling any entity to store and analyze Tweets for a period exceeding 30 days unless you are doing so on behalf of an academic institution and for the sole purpose of non-commercial research or you have received the express written permission of Twitter, or (b) enabling any entity to circumvent any other limitations or restrictions on the distribution of Twitter Content as contained in this Policy, the Twitter Developer Agreement, or any other agreement with Twitter.










Use and display Twitter Marks solely to identify Twitter as the source of Content.


Comply with 
Twitter Brand Assets and Guidelines
 as well as the 
Periscope Trademark guidelines
.
          


Do not do any of the following:
            


Use a single application API key for multiple use cases or multiple application API keys for the same use case.


Charge a premium above your Service's standard data and usage rates for access to Content via SMS or USSD.


Sell or receive monetary or virtual compensation for Tweet actions, Periscope Broadcasts actions or the placement of Tweet actions on your Service, such as, but not limited to follow, retweet, like, heart, comment and reply.


Do not use, access or analyze the Twitter API to monitor or measure the availability, performance, functionality, usage statistics or results of Twitter Services or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes, including without limitation, monitoring or measuring:
                


the responsiveness of Twitter Services; or


aggregate Twitter user metrics such as total number of active users, accounts, total number of Periscope Broadcast views, user engagements or account engagements.






Use Twitter Content, by itself or bundled with third party data, to target users with advertising outside of the Twitter platform, including without limitation on other advertising networks, via data brokers, or through any other advertising or monetization services.


Use Twitter Marks, or Twitter Certified Products Program badges, or similar marks or names in a manner that creates a false sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or association with Twitter.


Use the Twitter Verified Account badge, Verified Account status, or any other enhanced user categorization on Twitter Content other than that reported to you by Twitter through the API.












G. Avoid Replicating the Core Twitter Experience
¶




Twitter discourages online services from replicating Twitter Service’s core user experience or features.


The following rules apply solely to Services or applications that attempt to replicate Twitter’s core user experience:
            


You must obtain our permission to have more than 100,000 user tokens, and you may be subject to additional terms.


Use the Twitter API 
as provided by Twitter
 for functionalities in your Service that are substantially similar to a Twitter Service feature and present this to your users as the default option.
              


Display a prominent link or button in your Service that directs new users to Twitter’s sign-up functionality.


Do not do the following:
                


Pay, or offer to pay, third parties for distribution. This includes offering compensation for downloads (other than transactional fees) or other mechanisms of traffic acquisition.


Arrange for your Service to be pre-installed on any other device, promoted as a "zero-rated" service, or marketed as part of a specialized data plan.


Use Twitter Content or other data collected from users to create or maintain a separate status update, social network, private messaging or live broadcasting database or service.
















H. Engage in Appropriate Commercial Use
¶




Advertising Around Twitter Content
            


You may advertise around and on sites that display Tweets and Periscope Broadcasts, but you may not place any advertisements within the Twitter timeline or on or within Periscope Broadcasts on your Service other than Twitter Ads or advertisements made available through the official Twitter Kit integration with MoPub. Access to MoPub ads through Twitter Kit requires a MoPub supply account and is subject to MoPub terms of service & policies.


Your advertisements cannot resemble or reasonably be confused by users as a Tweet or Periscope Broadcast.


You may advertise in close proximity to the Twitter timeline or a Periscope Broadcast (e.g., banner ads above or below timeline), but there must be a clear separation between Twitter content and your advertisements.






Twitter reserves the right to serve advertising via Twitter APIs (“Twitter Ads”). If you decide to serve Twitter Ads once we start delivering them, we will share a portion of advertising revenue with you in accordance with the relevant terms and conditions.










II. Rules for Specific Twitter Services or Features

If you use 
Twitter for Websites
 widgets, you must ensure that an end user is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the end user’s device as described in Twitter's 
cookie use
 where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.
